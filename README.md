Coding Dojo .netCore and C# fundamentals. Validating Form Submission assignment

Validating Form Submission
We need to apply the concepts of Models and Model validations that we learned from the past two tabs. Make a small app that runs validations on a variety of form fields. Use Data Annotations and Models to generate your error messages. Errors should be rendered for each field that submits invalid data. This app is a similar process to that of Dojo Survey just making sure to focus in on these new concepts!

Create a form that accepts the displayed fields
Build a User model (object) that reflects each of these fields with all proper validations
If any of the validations fail, redirect back to the form page and display the relevant errors
If there are no errors instead display a success page!
